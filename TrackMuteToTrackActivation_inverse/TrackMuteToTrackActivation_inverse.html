        </div>

    <div id="introduction">
        <p>Bitwig Studio controller script, intended to enable muting the note output of note-only tracks.</p>
        
        <p>However, this is achieved in a VERY QUICK AND DIRTY manner, by linking the 
		track mute state for FOR ALL TRACKS (i.e. also audio-only tracks) in Bitwig Studio 
		to the activation state of tracks (/ channels).</p>
		
		<p>The (maximum) number of tracks (excluding master track and effect tracks) 
		being observed can be configured by the user. 
		<br>It is recommended to set this to a relatively small number of tracks, 
		and reserve the same amount of tracks in (all) your projects for notes-only tracks.<p>
		
		<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: may lead to 'hanging' notes sent between tracks (similar to 'hanging' MIDI notes), 
		and also 'hanging' notes within the native instrument devices (which is a bit different; 
		the *envelopes* of the notes also seem to 'hang').</p>
        
        <p>NB: also see the "TrackMuteForNoteOutput" sibling script for a slightly 
        more sophisticated approach, that does *not* affect audio-only tracks. 
        <br><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not use these two scripts simultaneously!</p>
