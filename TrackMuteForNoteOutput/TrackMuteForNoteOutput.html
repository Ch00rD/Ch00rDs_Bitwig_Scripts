    <div id="introduction">
        <p>Bitwig Studio controller script, intended to enable muting the note output of non-audio tracks.</p> 
        
        <p>This is achieved by linking the track mute state for instrument tracks (i.e. non-audio tracks) in Bitwig Studio to the activation state of tracks (/ channels).</p>
        
        <p>The (maximum) number of tracks (excluding master track and effect tracks) being observed can be configured by the user. <br>It is recommended to set this to a relatively large number of tracks, at least as large as the total number of tracks in (all) your projects. <p>
        
        <p>(TODO:) A more sophisticated approach is planned, which only affects a track if the first device in its chain is of the Note Filter type, and its preset has some specific name, e.g. "Mute Notes").</p>
