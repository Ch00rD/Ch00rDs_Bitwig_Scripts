            <h1>TRACK MUTE FOR NOTE FILTERS</h1>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="introduction">
        <p>Bitwig Studio controller script, intended to enable muting the note output 
        of "Instrument" tracks.</p> 
        
        <p>This is achieved by linking the track mute state for "Instrument" tracks 
        in Bitwig Studio to the activation state of Note Filter devices which have 
        been configured (by the Bitwig Studio user) as 'Primary' device for a track, 
        and are using a preset named "Mute All Notes" (which should be a preset that 
        has both its (minimum and maximum) "velocity" parameters set to 0).</p>
        
        <p>Note, however, that <strong>this script does not mute the output of any 
        other (MIDI) events</strong>, such as CCs, aftertouch, or pitch bend!</p>
        
        <p>Also note that <strong>this script may need to be reloaded whenever tracks are 
		reordered</strong>, as the "Primary" devices the script initially creates for specific 
		tracks 'stick' to those specific tracks, rather than a specific track number.
        
        <p>The (maximum) number of tracks (excluding master track and effect tracks) 
        being observed can be configured by the user. It is recommended to set this 
        to a relatively large number of tracks, at least as large as the total number 
        of tracks in (all) your projects. <p>
        
        <p>NB: also see the "TrackMuteForMIDIOutput" and "TrackMuteToTrackActivation_inverse" 
        sibling scripts for less sophisticated approaches, which disable the entire track, 
        and (in the latter case) *also* affects 'hybrid' and audio-only tracks.
        <br><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not try to use more than one of these 
        scripts simultaneously as this may lead to unexpected results; this has 
        not been tested.</p>
