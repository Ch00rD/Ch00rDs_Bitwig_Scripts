            <h1>TRACK MUTE FOR NOTE FILTERS</h1>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="introduction">
        <p>Bitwig Studio controller script, intended to enable muting the note output of non-audio tracks.</p> 
        
        <p>This is achieved by linking the track mute state for instrument tracks 
        (i.e. non-audio tracks) in Bitwig Studio to the activation state of Note 
        Filter devices in specific tracks (only - for usability reasons), namely 
        those which have been configured (by the Bitwig Studio user) as 'Primary' 
        device for a track, and are using a preset named "Mute All Notes" (which 
        should be a preset that has both its (minimum and maximum) "velocity" 
        parameters set to 0). </p>
        
        <p>The (maximum) number of tracks (excluding master track and effect tracks) 
        being observed can be configured by the user.
        <br>It is recommended to set this to a relatively large number of tracks, 
        at least as large as the total number of tracks in (all) your projects. <p>
        
   		<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: may lead to 'hanging' notes sent between tracks (similar to 'hanging' MIDI notes), and also 'hanging' notes within the native instrument devices (which is a bit different; the *envelopes* of the notes also seem to 'hang').</p>

        <p>NB: also see the "TrackMuteForNoteOutput" and "TrackMuteToTrackActivation_inverse" 
        sibling scripts for less sophisticated approaches, that disable the entire track, 
        and (for the latter) *also* affects audio-only tracks.
        <br><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not try to use more than one of these 
        scripts simultaneously as this may lead unexpected results; this has 
        not been tested.</p>
