Custom Controller Scripts for Bitwig Studio

These are Scripts I created for Bitwig Studio both for my own use and to help other users with their setups.

Install them in the Bitwig User directory:
Windows: ~Documents\Bitwig Studio\Controller Scripts
Mac: ~Documents/Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts
Linux: ~Documents/Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts

Controller Specific:
- Akai MPD 18
- Doepfer LMK 3
- CopperLan VMidi 1 & 2

Non-Specific Controllers:
- Acme Keyboard (Result of my basic Scripting Tutorial here: http://blog.thomashelzle.de/2014/04/bitwig-studio-tutorial-1how-to-create-named-controllers/
- Generic Midi Keyboard InOut (Omni, all CCs mappable, Midi Beat Clock...)
- TomsGenericKeyboard (16 separate Midi Channels, Midi Beat Clock, all CCs mappable...)
- TomsGenericMultiControl (16 separate Midi Channels, Midi Beat Clock, all CCs mappable per Midi Channel...)
- TomsMultiBiController (16 separate Midi Channels, Midi Beat Clock, all CCs mappable per Midi Channel, Bidirectional Feedback for CCs...)

Utility:
- "The Defaulter", a script that uses the Controller API to allow some basic defaults for projects and views in it's preferences. Also, it saves the current project settings in the IO Panel and restores these per-project.
Enjoy!

Cheers,

Tom
