            <h1>TRACK MUTE FOR MIDI OUTPUT</h1>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="introduction">
        <p>Bitwig Studio controller script, intended to enable muting the MIDI output
        (i.e. notes and other MIDI events such as CCs, aftertouch, or pitch bend) of 
        "Instrument" type tracks.</p> 
        
        <p>This is achieved by linking the track mute state for instrument tracks 
        (i.e. non-audio tracks) in Bitwig Studio to the activation state of tracks.</p>
        
        <p>The (maximum) number of tracks (excluding master track and effect tracks) 
        being observed can be configured by the user. It is recommended to set this 
        to a relatively large number of tracks, at least as large as the total number 
        of tracks in (all) your projects. <p>
        
        <p>(TODO:) A more sophisticated approach is planned, which only affects a track 
        if the first device in its chain is of the Note Filter type, and its preset 
        has some specific name, e.g. "Mute All Notes").</p>
        
   		<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: may lead to 'hanging' notes sent between 
   		tracks (similar to 'hanging' MIDI notes), and also 'hanging' notes 
   		within the native instrument devices (which is a bit different; 
   		the *envelopes* of the notes also seem to 'hang').</p>

        <p>NB: also see the "TrackMuteToTrackActivation_inverse" sibling script 
        for a less sophisticated approach, that *also* affects audio-only tracks.
        <br><strong>WARNING</strong>: Do not use these two scripts simultaneously!</p>
